## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES:**

1. **Packages:** You need to manually edit each package one by one. The form currently shows Bronze - after saving it, you'll need to find other packages in the list and edit them.

2. **Level Percentages:** The system validates that total = 100%. If it doesn't show 100%, adjust until it does.

3. **Save Each Page:** Don't forget to click the "Save" button on each admin page after making changes.
